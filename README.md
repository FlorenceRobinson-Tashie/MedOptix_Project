📌 ✅ What I’m About to Do:
I’ll create a clean, well-commented, Markdown checklist you can add to your README.md or a docs/setup_instructions.md file.
It will explain:

How to set up the virtual environment

Fixing PowerShell script issues

Installing dependencies

Saving them to requirements.txt

Enabling long file path support (if necessary)

How to use it daily

# 📦 MedOptix Project — Environment Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up your local development environment for the MedOptix project.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites  
✅ Python 3.11+ installed on your system  
✅ VS Code installed with Python extension

---

## 📦 1️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

In your VS Code terminal:

```powershell
python -m venv med_env
This will create a folder called med_env/ inside your project folder.
You don’t push this folder to GitHub — it’s ignored via .gitignore

⚙️ 2️⃣ Allow PowerShell to Run Activation Scripts
By default, PowerShell blocks scripts for safety.
Before activating your environment, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
This only affects the current terminal session.

📦 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment
Now, activate the environment with:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\med_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
✅ You’ll know it’s active when your terminal prompt shows:

scss
Copy
Edit
(med_env) PS C:\...\MedOptix_Project_Folder>
📦 4️⃣ Install Project Dependencies
Once activated, install your required libraries:

powershell
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyterlab notebook
📦 5️⃣ Save Dependencies to requirements.txt
After installing your packages:

powershell
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
✅ This file lists all installed packages and versions.
You should commit this file to GitHub.

⚙️ 6️⃣ Enable Windows Long Path Support (One-Time System Fix)
If you get errors like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory...
Windows has a default limit on file path length (260 characters). To fix this:

Option A (if your system has Group Policy Editor)
Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc → Enter

Go to:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Filesystem
Double-click Enable Win32 long paths

Set to Enabled

Apply and restart your PC

Option B (if using Windows Home Edition)
Press Win + R, type regedit → Enter

Navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
Find LongPathsEnabled

If missing, right-click → New > DWORD (32-bit) Value → name it LongPathsEnabled

Set its value to 1

Restart your PC

📦 7️⃣ Update pip (Recommended)
While the virtual environment is active:

powershell
Copy
Edit
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
📦 8️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebooks Inside med_env
If you're using Jupyter:

Install the IPython kernel:

powershell
Copy
Edit
pip install ipykernel
Add the med_env as a Jupyter kernel:

powershell
Copy
Edit
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=med_env
Now you can select med_env as your kernel inside VS Code’s Jupyter extension.

✅ Workflow Summary
Every time you return to this project:

Open your terminal

Run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
.\med_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Start coding 🚀

📌 Notes:
The med_env/ folder is ignored by Git via .gitignore

requirements.txt should be committed to Git

Push to GitHub after major changes or milestones

✨ That’s it — you’re all set to work like a pro!

## 📦✅ What You Can Do Next:
- Save this in your `README.md`  
**or**  
- Create a `docs/` folder and save as `setup_instructions.md`

Would you like me to generate a clean `README.md` template for your MedOptix project too, so you have a great base? 🚀
